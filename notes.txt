/////////////////////Observations:
-Seems to parse "Editor" text.  

- # = h1
- ## = h2
- ## = h3?
-double asterisks = bold
-enclosed in underscore = italics
-enclosed with 2 ~ symbols = crossed out
-enclosed by backticks = code
-enclosed by triple backticks = multi-line code
- > = Block Quote
- number followed by period = initiates a numbered list
    - each following line must initiate with a symbol to continue numbered list
- dashes = list items
- indenting = indented list items

-links...

/////////////////////TESTS:
#Technology Stack
1. You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery 
to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) 
because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not 
listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at 
supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently 
supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested 
technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

#Tests
1. I can see a <textarea> element with corresponding id="editor"

2. I can see an element with corresponding id="preview"

3. When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type 
    to display the content of the textarea

4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as 
    HTML in the #preview element as I type (Hint: You don't need to parse Markdown 
    yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked)

5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should 
    contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: 
    a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list 
    item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text

6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should 
    be rendered as HTML in the #preview element

7. OPTIONAL BONUS (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer 
    interprets carriage returns and renders them as <br> (line break) elements (HINT: 
    read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
